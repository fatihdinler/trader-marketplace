# Trader Marketplace - Backend Project (Monolithic Architecture)

This project is a **monolithic backend architecture** for an e-commerce application named `trader-marketplace`. The goal of the project is to build a feature-rich and modular backend system using the **Node.js ecosystem**, while also exploring and implementing several real-world development and deployment practices.

## üì¶ Project Overview

The application will consist of five primary modules:

- **Admin Module**: For system-wide management, user control, and platform configuration.
- **Vendor Module**: For product uploads, order management, and store analytics.
- **Customer Module**: For customer registration, login, shopping cart, and order tracking.
- **Shopping Module**: Core module for product discovery, search, indexing, and checkout process.
- **Delivery Module**: Manages delivery personnel, live tracking, and order status updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling requests and business logic.
- **NoSQL Database**: Likely MongoDB, for scalable and flexible schema design.
- **Indexing & Caching**: For performance optimization, faster query response using in-memory storage like Redis.

## üîê Authentication & Verification

- **Social Login Integration**: Users will be able to log in using their social media accounts (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **OTP-Based Verification**: Integration with **Twilio** to send One-Time Passwords to users and delivery personnel for secure identity verification.

## üìç Real-Time Location Services

- Using **Firebase** and **location services** to gain experience with:
  - Real-time tracking of delivery personnel.
  - Location-aware order updates for customers.

## üí≥ Payment Integration

- **Stripe** and **PayPal** will be integrated as payment gateways for secure and reliable payment handling.

## üì¨ Notifications & Communication

- Implementing notification systems including:
  - Push notifications.
  - Email notifications (order updates, promotions, etc.).

## üß± Advanced Topics

### API Gateway & Message Queue

- Building a centralized **API Gateway** for routing and monitoring.
- Integrating **Message Queue (MQ)** systems (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services/modules.

### Containerization & Orchestration

- **Docker**: Containerizing the backend services for environment consistency and portability.
- **Kubernetes**: Managing container deployment, scaling, and endpoint routing efficiently.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Plan

- Deployment and scalability on cloud platforms:
  - **AWS**
  - **DigitalOcean**

The deployment pipeline will include setting up CI/CD, environment variables, container registry, and load balancing.

## ‚úÖ Goals

- Build a modular and maintainable backend system using Node.js.
- Get hands-on experience with real-time systems and scalable deployment.
- Learn to integrate and manage third-party services like Firebase, Twilio, and Stripe.
- Explore DevOps concepts through containerization and orchestration.
